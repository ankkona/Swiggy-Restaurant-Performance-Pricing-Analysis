# Swiggy-Restaurant-Performance-Pricing-Analysis
This project analyzes restaurant-level data from an online food delivery platform (Swiggy) to derive insights on pricing, customer ratings, cuisine distribution and delivery operations.

# Data Cleaning
- Modified the ratings in a range in another column.
- Standardized veg information by creating a clean Food Category column with only two values: Veg and Non-Veg.
- Standardized long-distance delivery information by creating Long_Dist_flag with values: Long Distance and Normal.
